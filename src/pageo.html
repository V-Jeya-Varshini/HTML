        <header><h2>India T20 with West Indies</h2></header>
        <p>Content:
            Suryakumar Yadav (34 off 18 balls) and Venkatesh Iyer (24 off 13 balls) took India home with more than an over to spare as the hosts won the first T20I against West Indies at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata by 6 wickets. Rohit Sharma (40) had given his team a flying start before losing his wicket to Roston Chase. West Indies pegged India back with the wickets of Virat Kohli (17), Ishan Kishan (35) and Rishabh Pant (8) but eventually their total was too low to mount a big challenge. Earlier, Ravi Bishnoi picked up the wickets of Roston Chase and Rovman Powell to end with figures of 2/17 on his international debut as India restricted West Indies to 157/7 in 20 overs. Bhuvneshwar Kumar gave India the perfect start by picking up a wicket in the very first over after Rohit Sharma decided to bowl on winning the toss. Yuzvendra Chahal gave India their second wicket. Bishnoi took a good catch of Nicholas Pooran at the boundary but stepped on the rope to give the southpaw a reprieve. Pooran used the opportunity well as he slammed an effective half-century. Captain Kieron Pollard produced some big hits in the death overs to help the Windies post a total in excess of 150.</p>
